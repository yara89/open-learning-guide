# Open Learning Introduction

## jHUB OPEN LEARNING HANDBOOK & TOOLKIT

jHUB experienced trainers and facilitators offer a supportive environment to find and attend online education media training resources. Independent guidance to identify, access P2P learning & share new knowledge with your community.

The Blended Learning approach combines on-location seminars with preparation and post‐processing, as well as moderated self‐learning phases in a virtual learning platform, using a variety of digital media and tools. In the context of South Sudan, where most people do not have access to the Internet at home, jHUB provides both the space for on-location seminars, for groups of learners to meet and prepare or post-process the seminars, and for learners to conduct their self-learning.

Knowledge about and use of open source software and open source hardware both play an important role for jHUB. The members have learned how to upcycle used hardware components to build their own solar chargers, which they now use to charge cell phones, cameras and other electronic equipment, independent of the power supply of the fuel-powered generator.
